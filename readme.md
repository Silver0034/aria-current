# Add Aria Current to Links - WordPress Plugin

Automatically add `aria-current="page"` to WordPress blocks linking to the current page.

## Overview

This plugin automatically adds the `aria-current="page"` attribute to blocks that link to the current page. This helps improve accessibility by indicating the current page in navigation.

## How It Works

The plugin uses a filter to modify the block content before it is rendered. It checks if the block contains a link to the current page and adds the `aria-current="page"` attribute to the link if it does.
